# Project Overview

This research is part of the [Moose Research Initiative](https://friresearch.ca/project/moose-research-initiative) and Theme 4 focuses on examining how historical and current forest management practices, along with conservation efforts aimed at species such as woodland caribou, impact moose populations and their habitat in Alberta. Additionally, there is a need to enhance monitoring techniques for moose in forested areas and evaluate the effects of climate change on moose populations and their habitat in the future. This report summarizes the progress achieved from June 1st to September 30th under the Moose Research Initiative (MRI), specifically highlighting Theme 4. Significant advancements have been made during this period aligning with the projectâ€™s objectives.

Theme 4 aims to assess the feasibility and potential of unmanned aerial systems (referred to as drones) for wildlife surveys, comparing them with current survey methods. The theme encompasses four primary objectives:
1. Statistical validity of different drone data acquisition flight plans
2. Validation of detection of moose on snow using thermal / RGB cameras
3. Full-scale proof of concept and scaling to fixed-wing operational solutions
4. Best practice guide

This document details completed tasks, progress against the timeline, challenges encountered, and identifies areas needing further attention to ensure ongoing project success. Progress has been made towards achieving the first key objective. Literature reviews, sharing, and analysis of helicopter survey data, and the development of simulation coding are crucial steps towards fulfilling this objective.
